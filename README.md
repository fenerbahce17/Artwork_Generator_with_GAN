# Artwork_Generator_with_GAN


This project focuses on classifying artworks based on their artistic style using deep learning techniques. A dataset containing images of artworks from various art movements was used to train a neural network model to perform image classification.


##  Technologies Used

- Python 
- TensorFlow / Keras 
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab (for training and development)


##  Notes
Dataset should be organized in subfolders for each class/art style.

This project can be extended with transfer learning (e.g., using VGG16, ResNet).
